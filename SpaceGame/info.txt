Population size is 600

Rocks go in a random direction on screen
Each rock has a 30 percent chance of targeting a ship

Input layer is a vector of size 15 containing the distance from each rock 
The values are normalized so each value is between 0 and 1

Two hidden layers containing 10 nodes each 

Output has 3 nodes 

Fitness function is based only on time 

Using single point crossover on the weight matrices 

Each value in all weight matrices have a 15 percent chance of being mutated

Top 50 percent of ships are chosen to breed

Keep the ships from the 25 percent point up to the 50 percent point 

All top 75 percent ships are mutated
