Population size is 600

Rocks go in a random direction on screen
Each rock has a 30 percent chance of targeting a ship

Input layer is a vector of size 8
Ship looks in 8 cardinal direction directions 
The distances from a rock or the wall in that direction is calculated
The values are normalized so each value is between 0 and 1

Two hidden layers containing 10 nodes each 

Output has 3 nodes 

Fitness function is based on the values in the input layer
If a distance is greater than 150, the score is incremented
If all distances are greater than 150, then score is increased by 8
If only 2 distances are grater than 150, then score is increase by 2, etc.

If a ship goes to the end of the screen and appears on the other side, then the amount of times this occurs is increased by 5 and raised to the 4th power
The score is then subtracted by this value
Penalizing heavy for warping 

Using single point crossover on the weight matrices 

Each value in all weight matrices have a 8 percent chance of being mutated

Top 50 percent of ships are chosen to breed

Keep the ships from the 25 percent point up to the 50 percent point 

All top 75 percent ships are mutated
